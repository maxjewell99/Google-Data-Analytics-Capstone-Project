# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## About the Course
This capstone project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, a course designed to equip learners with practical skills in data analysis and business intelligence. Throughout the course, I developed proficiency in key areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

The curriculum introduced me to various tools and software essential for modern data analytics, including:

- Google Sheets: for data cleaning, manipulation, and creating visualizations such as pivot tables and charts.

- SQL: for querying and managing relational databases, extracting meaningful datasets from large databases.

- R Programming (Basics): an introduction to statistical programming for data analysis and visualization (which I plan to explore more in upcoming projects).

- Tableau: for creating interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-share system aiming to increase annual memberships by understanding how casual and annual riders use their bikes differently. This analysis explores ride patterns to inform marketing and operational strategies.

My business task was to analyze and compare the usage behavior of annual members and casual riders using Cyclistic bike-share data, in order to provide data-driven insights that will support the development of targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.


## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I enhanced my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and business storytelling. I gained hands-on experience working with imperfect data and learned how to draw actionable insights for stakeholders.


## Next Steps
For this project I kept it streamlined with using one software, being Google Sheets. However, after exploring R during the course and finding it exciting to use, my next project will include R and it's visualisation capabilities.

## Additional Resources
I will leave links below to Google Sheets I that I used for analysis.
