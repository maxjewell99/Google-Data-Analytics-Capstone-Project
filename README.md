# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## About the Course
This capstone project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, a course designed to equip learners with practical skills in data analysis and business intelligence. Throughout the course, I developed proficiency in key areas such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

The curriculum introduced me to various tools and software essential for modern data analytics, including:

- Google Sheets: for data cleaning, manipulation, and creating visualizations such as pivot tables and charts.

- SQL: for querying and managing relational databases, extracting meaningful datasets from large databases.

- R Programming (Basics): an introduction to statistical programming for data analysis and visualization (which I plan to explore more in upcoming projects).

- Tableau: for creating interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-share system aiming to increase annual memberships by understanding how casual and annual riders use their bikes differently. This analysis explores ride patterns to inform marketing and operational strategies.


## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I enhanced my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and business storytelling. I gained hands-on experience working with imperfect data and learned how to draw actionable insights for stakeholders.


## Next Steps
For this project I kept it streamlined with using one software, being Google Sheets. However, after exploring R during the course and finding it exciting to use, my next project will include R and it's visualisation capabilities.
